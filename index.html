<title>ACE RTSW Telemetry Demodulator</title>

<h1>
ACE RTSW Telemetry Demodulator v3.0.2 (3 Jan 2000)</h1>
This <a href="acedemod-3.0.2.tar.gz">package</a>
implements a pure software demodulator and decoder for the S-band 434 bps
<a href="http://sec.noaa.gov/ace/ACErtsw_home.html">Real
Time Solar Wind</a> telemetry stream from the <a href="http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/">Advanced
Composition Explorer</a> (ACE) spacecraft located at the L1 libration point
between the earth and sun.
<p>I wrote this code to help
<a href="http://www.sec.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a>,
the operator of the spacecraft, close coverage gaps with additional groundstations
around the world. They didn't have the budget to buy the necessary hardware
decoders, so I volunteered to do it in software to demonstrate the powerful
digital signal processing that can now be done on garden-variety PCs.
<h2>
Demodulating the Signal</h2>

The program <b>acedemod</b> performs the demodulation.&nbsp; It expects
a baseband manchester-encoded receive signal sampled at 9600 Hz with 16
bits per sample, in signed little-endian (PC) byte order. Another sample rate
can be specified with the -s or --sample-rate command line option.

(The Linux <b>brec</b>
utility can be used to read from the sound card and pipe its output to
the input of <b>acedemod</b>).
<p>The demodulator takes three options:
<br><b>-d|--debug</b> to specify the debug level;
<br><b>-f|--full-frame </b>to specify full frame output, including sync and RS parities
(normally only the data is output)
<br><b>-m|--no-mmx</b> to disable the automatic use of MMX, if present (x86 machines
only)
<br><b>-s|--sample-rate</b> to specify the input sample rate (default 9600 Hz).
<br><b>-o|--no-offset</b> disables repeated decoding attempts with increasing
subcarrier phase offsets on frames that do not initially decode
<br><b>-v|--no-mmx-vd</b> disables the MMX version of the Viterbi decoder
without totally disabling the use of MMX instructions.
<p>The program as supplied simply demodulates the data and sends it to
standard output; comments in the source indicate where code can be added
to further format the data and send it over the Internet to a central collection
point as desired.
<p>Note that <b>acedemod</b> expects its input at baseband. It assumes
that a receiver with a PLL is tracking the residual carrier on the spacecraft
downlink and downconverting the signal to audio with the carrier at zero
frequency. A to-do project is to implement such a receiver in DSP that
can be run in a UNIX pipe ahead of
<b>acedemod</b>, thus allowing the RF
equipment to consist merely of a fixed-frequency downconverter that shifts
the composite telemetry to within the passband of a standard PC sound card's
A/D converter.
<h2>
Generating Test Signals</h2>
The program <b>gensig</b> is provided to generate a test signal in the
ACE format. I wrote it because the SNR on the test tapes I was given was
so high that I never had a chance to see how my demodulator worked at low
SNR. The <b>gensig</b> program reads data from standard input, encodes
and bi-phase modulates this data into 16-bit signed little-endian baseband
audio samples and sends them to standard output in a format that can be
piped directly into <b>acedemod</b>. Noise can be added to simulate any
desired Eb/No ratio.

<b>gensig</b> is invoked as follows:
<p><b>gensig [-a amplitude] [-f subcarrier freq] [-e ebno] [-s samplerate]</b>
<p>where the amplitude is the peak signal output amplitude in sample units
(32767 being full scale for signed 16-bit samples), the subcarrier frequency
defaults to 996 Hz (and probably shouldn't be changed), and the ebno is
specified in decibels (default 10 dB, a very strong signal).
<p>The coding used here will operate pretty solidly down to EbNo = 3dB,
and will start breathing hard below that. At about 2.6-2.7 dB, you'll start
to see a few RS blocks that cannot be corrected. Below 2.5 dB, lots of
blocks are lost. This steep error curve is typical of systems with strong
FEC.
<h2>
ACE Telemetry Format</h2>
Here we get into the gory details of the telemetry format and how I decode
it. The CCSDS telemetry stream is formed as follows:
<p><al>
<li>
Each fixed-size RTSW frame contains 6912 bits (864 bytes) of user telemetry
data.</li>

<li>
To this is appended 1024 bits (128 bytes) of parity information from a
(248,216) Reed-Solomon code over GF(256) derived by shortening the CCSDS
standard (255,223) RS code and applying 4-way interleaving. This produces
7936 bits (992 bytes).</li>

<li>
A 32-bit CCSDS-standard sync vector (0x1acffc1d) is added to the front
of the RS-coded block, producing 7968 bits (996 bytes). Note that the sync
vector is not included in the Reed-Solomon codeword.</li>

<li>
The resulting data frame, including the sync vector, is run through a rate
1/2 constraint length 7 convolutional encoder, producing 15936 channel
symbols.</li>

<li>
The output of the convolutional encoder is biphase-level (Manchester II)
encoded.</li>

<li>
The biphase-encoded signal phase-shift-keys the main S-band beacon with
a phase shift of about +/-64 degrees. This leaves substantial residual
carrier for receiver tracking.</al></li>

<h2>
Telemetry FEC</h2>
The Reed-Solomon coding, the sync vector and the convolutional encoder
are all specified by <a href="http://www.ccsds.org/">CCSDS standards</a>,
specifically
<a href="http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x0b1.pdf">
CCSDS 131.0-B1: TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a>.

I started with my own Viterbi and Reed-Solomon decoders, but found I had
to make several changes.
<p>I had already implemented a Viterbi decoder for the CCSDS k=7 r=1/2
polynomials, but the CCSDS convention for the polarity and order of the
two symbols for each input bit was different. This was a relatively straightforward
change.
<p>The Reed-Solomon decoder took more work. The CCSDS standard calls for
a "dual basis" representation of the 8-bit symbols. I implemented this
with a pair of 256-byte lookup tables, one to convert from dual-basis to
conventional representation before decoding, and an inverse table to convert
back to dual-basis after decoding. The CCSDS standard also specifies a
palindromic generator polynomial; this by itself was relatively easy to
accomodate. A bigger problem was that the roots of the CCSDS generator
polynomial are not consecutive, and in my decoder I had assumed they always
would be. I made the necessary generalizations to support this.
<h3>
Synchonization</h3>
The actual demodulation takes significant advantage of the structure of
the ACE telemetry frame. I start by generating a local replica of the convolutionally
encoded, manchester-modulated 32-bit sync vector and dragging that across
16 seconds worth of raw data looking for the biggest correlation peak.
But because of the 7-bit memory of the convolutional encoder, the first
14 channel symbols out of the convolutional encoder when the sync vector
begins transmission are "contaminated" by the last few bits of the preceeding
telemetry frame. So I actually look only for the trailing (32-7) * 2 =
50 symbols of the encoded sync vector. This still leaves sufficient energy
(nearly 16 dB SNR) for reliable detection at an operating EbNo of 2.5 dB.
<p>The sync vector correlator is quite compute intensive, especially on
the initial acquisition where a full 16 second window must be searched.
Version 2.0 of <b>acedemod</b> automatically uses the Intel MultiMedia
eXtensions (MMX) instructions, if available, to speed this operation substantially.
<h3>
Carrier Recovery and Demodulation</h3>
Since the ACE telemetry frame is exactly 16 seconds long, I
<i>know</i>
that a sync vector will be somewhere in my 16 second search window -- if
it's there at all. So when I find the peak correlation peak in the 16 second
search window, I skip ahead 16 seconds and find the biggest correlator
peak in a much smaller window (e.g., +/- 100 samples) looking for the next
sync vector -- the window allowing for frequency errors in the sound card
and/or spacecraft. Once I have these two peaks, I can quickly compute the
symbol clock frequency referred to the A/D converter clock. And since I
know that there are exactly 15936 symbols between these two peaks, I simply
interpolate the clock through the frame to undo the Manchester encoding
and to produce soft decision samples for the Viterbi decoder.
<h3>
Viterbi Decoding</h3>
One could use a continuous stream-mode Viterbi decoder on this signal at
this point, but it seemed more elegant to use a packet-mode decoder modified
to account for the known starting and terminal states of the convolutional
encoder at the transmitter. (The starting state is the last 7 bits of the
sync vector at the front of the frame, and the terminal state is the first
7 bits of the sync vector at the start of the next frame.) This turned
out to be a relatively trivial change to my existing packet-mode Viterbi
decoder.
<p>Version 3.0 of <b>acedemod</b> includes a Viterbi decoder that
uses MMX instructions, if available.
The speedup is approximately 3x on the Intel Pentium-II
and somewhat less on MMX-enabled Pentiums and AMD K-6s.
<h3>
Reed-Solomon Decoding</h3>
Once the Viterbi decoder has done its job, the decoded symbols are 4-way
deinterleaved for the Reed-Solomon decoding step. Since each RS block has
32 parity symbols, up to 16 errors can be corrected in each of the 4 RS
blocks in the telemetry frame. If more than 16 errors occur, the error
count is set to -1 to indicate that the frame is uncorrectible.
<p>If at least one of the RS blocks decodes successfully, the demodulator
assumes that it synchronized correctly and it proceeds to search for the
trailing sync vector at the end of the next frame using the same narrow
search used to find the vector that ended the current frame. But if none
of the RS blocks decoded, the demodulator assumes this was due to a loss
of synchronization so it repeats the full 16-second sync vector search
procedure. This is by far the most CPU-intensive part of the demodulator.&nbsp;
Version 2.0 of the demodulator uses the Intel MMX (Multi-Media eXtensions)
instructions, if available and enabled, to speed up this step.

<h3>Offset Searching</h3>

If the telemetry frame does not fully decode on the first try (i.e.,
one or more of the Reed-Solomon blocks does not decode), then acedemod
will attempt to repeat the demodulation and decoding process after
making small adjustments to the subcarrier phase. The offsets
alternate in sign and increase in magnitude until either the frame
fully decodes or the magnitude of the phase offset reaches an upper
limit (less than one A/D sample).

<p>Since the sync vector correlator can only estimate subcarrier
phase to the nearest A/D sample, this technique is especially beneficial
with low A/D sampling rates. It can be disabled with the <b>-o</b> or
<b>--no-offset</b> command line option.

<h3>
Further Experiments with Iterative Decoding</h3>
I have experimented a bit with some of the iterative decoding techniques
that can be applied to a concatenated Reed-Solomon/convolutional scheme
like this one. (These are not in the released code, though.) One trick
is <i>error forecasting</i>, based on the fact that when a Viterbi decoder
makes an error, it usually makes a burst of them several constraint lengths
long. This is several Reed-Solomon symbols for the parameters used here.
Because of the interleaving, these bursts will be spread across different
Reed-Solomon codewords (in fact, this is precisely the reason for the interleaving).
<p>Sometimes some but not all of the RS blocks in the frame will decode.
When this happens, the RS decoder can tell you where it found and corrected
errors in the blocks that did decode (it cannot tell you anything about
the blocks that didn't decode, though). But with this information, and
the knowledge that a RS decoder can correct up to twice as many errors
if you can tell it in advance <i>where</i> the errors are, you can try
telling the RS decoder to try the failed block(s) again, this time marking
as erasures the symbols corresponding to those that were successfully corrected
in the adjacent blocks.
<p>This works often enough to give you a few tenths of a dB of improvement
in Eb/No performance, but you have to be careful. Every time you erase
RS symbols before decoding a block, you increase the chances of the decoder
succeeding but you also increase its chances of making an undetected error!
For this reason I have not released the iterative decoding stuff until
I can further characterize its undetected error rate.
<p>Another form of iterative decoding involves repeating the Viterbi decoder
step. It's known that a Viterbi decoder is less likely to make errors when
decoding in the vicinity of data it already knows (such as the first or
last few bits of a frame with known starting and terminal encoder states).
We can apply the same principle to RS code blocks that fail to decode when
they're straddled by RS blocks that did decode. We simply use the decoded
RS data (which is highly reliable because of the redundancy in that code)
to "pin" the Viterbi decoder in a second run over the data that didn't
decode. In this case, I actually perform 248 separate runs of the Viterbi
decoder, one for each byte in the failed RS frame. I used the same feature
I had already added to the Viterbi decoder to handle the non-zero starting
and terminal encoder states in the first decoding pass on the frame.
<p>Surprisingly enough, this technique seemed to help little, if at all.
The Viterbi decoder almost never "changed its mind" when given firm knowledge
of the adjacent data. The one exception occurred occasionally in the very
last byte of the frame. It turned out that I had made a fencepost error
in my original Viterbi decoding pass (the terminal state was shifted off
by one bit), but I was giving it the correct terminal state in the redecoding
pass. Funny how FEC can sometimes be so strong that it even corrects for
programming errors!
<p>This is somewhat consistent with the literature, which gives a much
smaller EbNo improvement (.1-.2 dB) for the iterated Viterbi decoding with
state pinning than for the iterated Reed-Solomon coding.
